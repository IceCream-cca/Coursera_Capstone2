    "Both Toronto and New York are the most popular city and financial capital of their own country. Most of the foreigner,including me, might to live or travel or know the similarity and disimilarity of these two diverse city. Therefore, in this project, we will segment and compare this two cities based on:\n",

    "3. **The most popular restaurant of the two cities in order to know whether they have the same preferable food or not**\n",

Moreover, it will also helpful for the person who is confusing whether he/she should open their new resturant in New York or Toronto because this project result can help them to understand what is the favorate/popular foods for the city dwellers."
